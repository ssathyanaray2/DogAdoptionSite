I have completed the minimum requirements but couldn't sumbit the public repository link and hosting link in greenhouse as I am not able to access the greenhouse account. I am pasting it here.I have used AWS static hosting.

Public Repository Link: https://github.com/ssathyanaray2/DogAdoptionSite


Steps to run locally:

cd app/dog-adoption-frontend
